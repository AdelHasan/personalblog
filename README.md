# GA Capstone Project: Personal Blog

## Overview

### User Stories
#### Me (author)
I want this blog to be a place where I can share my experiences and reflections on my process of becoming a developer. My use for the blog will be primarily focused on discussing my experiences learning and discussions of various development languages/frameworks/libraries. That said, the range of topics will be a fairly open-ended, dynamic representation of my current interests over time. For example:

- Retrospective on general assembly projects
- Retrospective on general assembly experience
- Job search, interview process
- Discussion of some of my favorite books
- On various pieces of the history of the Indian subcontinent

The idea of building and deploying the platform I use to express my thoughts online is incredibly compelling for me.

## Post MVP
As I continue to work on this project, there are some key features that I want to focus on:
- Implementing a backend using GraphQL, and GraphCMS for content creation/updates/deletion
- Refactoring the blog to render via a static site generator like NextJS
- Deployment on a custom domain name
- Implementation of SEO
